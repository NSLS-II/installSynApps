# This file is where you can define the release versions of each of the packages
# that you would like to clone and build. Note that not every release version 
# can be interchanged with another and still work. Please consult documentation
# to determine which releases will work best for you
#
# NOTE: All releases are simply github tags. Write 'master' if you would like to simply compile the master branch
