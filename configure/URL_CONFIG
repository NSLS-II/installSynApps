# 
# This file will contain a list of remote git repository URLs that will be checked for 
# repositories. If you are adding a custom driver or module, add your github etc. URL here, and 
# add the module to each of the appropriate CONFIG files.
#
# Note: URLS will be tried in the order given, so if you prefer to use a different fork of a certain repo, place that
# URL above the other ones.
