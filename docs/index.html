    <h4>Introduction:</h4>
    <p class = "text-section-local">
        installSynApps is a python3 module that allows users to clone and build EPICS and synApps with a modular
        configuration system. Configuration options for building are automatically handled by the module, greatly
        simplifying the process for users unfamiliar with the EPICS build environment. The module is capable of
        injecting configuration options into target files as well, which is useful when external modules are being
        compiled that do not have the appropriate Makefile options within EPICS. installSynApps also allows for 
        auto setting of build flags, which further simplifies the process of compiling EPICS base, synApps, and areaDetector.

    <h4>Installation:</h4>
    <p class = "text-section-local">
        To install the installSynApps module, you may either <a href=https://github.com/epicsNSLS2-deploy/installSynApps>clone</a> the git repository, or download a
        <a href ="https://github.com/epicsNSLS2-deploy/installSynApps/releases" >release</a>. From there, make sure that it is unpacked if it was downloaded as 
        a tarfile or zip archive. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-section-local" >
        installSynApps requires that several external programs be installed and in the system path in order to run. Firstly, it requires python3, and if using the GUI
        version, Tkinter. On windows, python3 (which should include Tkinter) can be downloaded from the python <a href = "https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">website</a>.
        On linux, you may also use the website, or simply use the package manager, running the <code>sudo apt install python3 python3-tk</code> command. Next, installSynApps
        requires git, wget, and tar in order to download and unpack the entirety of EPICS and synApps. On linux, simply install these packages through the package manager:
        <code>sudo apt install git wget tar</code>. On windows, you may find wget <a href = "http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm">here</a>, and git and tar can be
        downloaded from the git <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">website</a>. When installing git, you will have the option to place git in your system path, which you
        should enable, and an option to install "UNIX tools", which will include tar. Finally, installSynApps requires make, perl, and a C/C++ compiler in order to actually build
        EPICS. On linux, install these by simply running <code>sudo apt install make gcc g++</code>. On windows, it is recommended to use the MinGW version of make, which can be found
        <a href = "http://www.mingw.org/">here</a>, Strawberry perl can be found <a href = "http://strawberryperl.com/">here</a>, and the recommended C/C++ compiler is a recent version 
        of the MSVC/MSVC++ compiler included with Visual Studio. Install all of these packages, and installSynApps is now ready for use.

    <h4>Windows Setup:</h4>
    <p class="text-section-local">
        On Windows, prior to running installSynApps, it is required to set up your build environment. First, all of the above described required packages must be in your system path. You
        may test this by opening a command prompt and typing <code>make</code>, <code>perl</code>, <code>git</code>, <code>tar</code>, and <code>wget</code>. If the output describes the usage
        of each module, it is correctly placed in the system path. If the message states that it is not a recognized program or batch file, check to make sure it was added to the path. Then, to
        initialize a Visual Studio build environment, in the command prompt, navigate to the Visual Studio intall directory (usually C:\Program Files (x86)), and follow this path: 
        "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\" replacing 2017 for your version of Visual Studio. Once in this directory, run the following command:
        <code>vcvarsall.bat x86_amd64</code>. This will set up your command prompt for buildng C/C++ applications with MSVC++ for 64bit windows. Next, run <code>set EPICS_HOST_ARCH=windows-x64-static</code>,
        and <code>set MAKEFLAGS=-w</code>. This will set some environment variables needed for the build. Once this is done, navigate to the installSynApps directory, and proceed as described below.
    </p>

    <h4>Install Configuration Setup</h4>
    <p class="text-section-local">
        The most important file for configuring your installation of EPICS, synApps, and areaDetector is the configure/INSTALL_CONFIG file:
        <img class='img-local' src="assets/INSTALL_CONFIG.png" alt="INSTALL_CONFIG example" />
        <br />
        In this file, you will find defined your INSTALL and EPICS_ARCH variables. INSTALL represents where installSynApps will clone all of its modules, and EPICS_ARCH represents your architecture. Current 
        support includes linux-x86_64, and win32-x86. Below these are the modules themselves, along with GIT_URL and WGET_URL definitions. Each module has a name, version, relative path, repository name,
        and options to clone and/or build it. installSynApps will locate the module at the most recently listed URL appended with the repository, and will use git clone if it is  a GIT_URL, or wget if it is
        a WGET_URL. Simply edit the version numbers and the CLONE/BUILD options as demonstrated in the image above to edit your install configuration. In addition, you may edit the INSTALL variable above to
        customize the install location. Note that all of these options may be customized through the GUI if using installGUI rather than installCLI.
    </p>

    <h4>Usage - installCLI</h4>
    <p class="text-section-local">
        One way to run installSynApps is to use the installCLI.py script. On linux this is done by running <code>./installCLI.py</code>, and on windows: <code>python installCLI.py</code>.
